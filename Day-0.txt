Q1. What does import in java means?

Q2. What packages in Java means?
Package in Java is a mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes, sub packages and interfaces. Packages are used for:

a) Preventing naming conflicts. For example there can be two classes with name Employee in two packages, college.staff.cse.Employee and college.staff.ee.Employee

b) Making searching/locating and usage of classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations easier

c) Providing controlled access: protected and default have package level access control. A protected member is accessible by classes in the same package and its subclasses. A default member (without any access specifier) is accessible by classes in the same package only.

d)Packages can be considered as data encapsulation (or data-hiding).
