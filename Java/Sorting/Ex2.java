// Write a Java program to sort an array of given integers using the Bubble Sorting Algorithm.

/* According to Wikipedia "Bubble sort, sometimes called sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted. It compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates the list is in order. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list. Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even compared to an insertion sort. It can be practical if the input is usually in sort order but occasionally has some out-of-order elements nearly in position."*/
