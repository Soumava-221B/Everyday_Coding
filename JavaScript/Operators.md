# Operators 

### The +(addition) operator is used for both addition and concatenation of strings.

For example, adding two variables is easy:
```JavaScript
{
var a = 1;

var b = 2;

var c = a + b;     // c is now equal to 3
}
```

### The addition operator is used for concatenating strings to strings, strings to numbers, and numbers to strings:
```JavaScript
var name = "John";

console.log("Hello " + name + "!");

console.log("The meaning of life is " + 42);

console.log(42 + " is the meaning of life");
```
